                            I am a software developer and I have been since I was little (about 8). Well, not really.
                            When I was little I remember
                            I went with my mom to work and she would be working and there was an extra computer I could
                            play on. I remember
                            seeing the Star Wars Jedi Academy on the desktop and I asked my mom if I could play it. She
                            said "... hmm... here
                            go through this Java book first." It was a pretty thick book and I remember doing the first
                            tutorial, once I had
                            installed eclipse anyways. I was doing my first tutorial and I remember it showing the
                            System.out.println(). I
                            thought it was so cool. Whatever I typed in the quotes between the parenthesis, when I ran
                            the program it would
                            print out. I remember going to my mom and saying "WOW MOM!!!! I can make the program say
                            whatever I want!!!" I was
                            so excited. Thinking back on it, it's a good thing she responded with enthusiasm, because to
                            her it was the very
                            most basic thing.

                            I live in Salt Lake City and I have my whole life. Ever since I was little we would go
                            hiking up at Ensign Peak and
                            the mountains behind it. We would go with my grandma and grandpa. My profile picture was
                            taken at my grandpa's birthday 2020.
                            The person I am holding who is cropped out is my 1 year old daughter.
